  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p> Yogesh Moolchandani, a disreputable builder, is dead. All the signs say suicide but there was nothing wrong with his life. He had just cracked a deal and things were looking hale and hearty for him. He had recently even purchased an imported Volkswagen Jetta. CCTV footage from the night of his death shows him crashing into a toll booth at a speed of 180 km per hour on the Bandra-Worli Sea Link. The dealer he had purc
    hased his car from had received five missed calls from him just five minutes prior to the time of the alleged
    crash.</p>

  <p>On the same night, in another part of town, Pranav Paleja, a criminal lawyer who works at the law chamber-
    Mangesh & Mangharam, tries his best to extricate his client-a troublesome drunk-from the clutches of the police.
    Although an upholder of the law himself, Paleja is pathologically incapable of following it in his day-to-day personal life. Since Pranav Paleja
    was settling a dispute with the man concerned only moments before the crash, the police land up at his doorstep.</p>
<p>As the authorities try to find out why Yogesh was calling his car dealer frantically, the plot begins to thicken.
  Who, or rather what, killed Yogesh Moolchandani?</p>
